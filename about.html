            <h2>About ACEO</h2>
            <p>Rooted in indigenous practices of mutual support and asset sharing in Amuria, Uganda.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="about-content">
            <h3>Who We Are</h3>
            <p><strong>Ajokon Community Empowerment Organization (ACEO)</strong> is a community-based organization rooted in indigenous practices of mutual support and asset sharing in Amuria, Uganda. We work to strengthen <em>household financial security and community resilience</em> through culturally grounded, asset-based, and community-led empowerment initiatives.</p>
            <p>ACEO believes that lasting change begins with <em>security, dignity, and collective responsibility</em> — not short-term handouts.</p>
            
            <h3>What Ajokon Means</h3>
            <p>Ajokon is an Ateso (Iteso) cultural practice that refers to sharing or entrusting livestock to another household so that both families benefit over time.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Vision</h3>
            <p><em>A resilient and self-reliant community where households are financially secure, supported by strong social networks and sustainable livelihoods.</em></p>
            
            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p><em>To strengthen household financial security and community resilience through asset-based empowerment, community savings mechanisms, and culturally grounded livelihood initiatives.</em></p>
            
            <h3>Our Focus</h3>
            <p>ACEO does not rely on single interventions. Instead, we focus on <em>reducing household economic vulnerability</em> and building resilience by enabling families to own productive assets, access community safety nets, and participate in collective growth.</p>
            
            <div class="flagship-project">
                <h3>Our Flagship Project</h3>
                <p><strong>Ajokon Goat Empowerment Project (AGEP)</strong></p>
                <p>AGEP is ACEO's flagship livelihood initiative implemented under the <em>Ajokon Plus Model</em>. The project uses rotational livestock sharing, community savings, and local monitoring to help households build <em>financial security over time</em>.</p>
                <p>A goat is treated not as instant income but as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A productive asset</li>
                    <li>A living savings account</li>
                    <li>A source of nutrition</li>
                    <li>A buffer against financial shocks</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>Ajokon was inspired by a long-standing community tradition in Amuria where families share livestock so that every household can one day own productive assets. ACEO was formed to strengthen this practice with structure, accountability, and community savings. Through initiatives like AGEP, we help households build financial security, not quick fixes — ensuring progress is shared, sustainable, and rooted in dignity.</p>
